      For example, say your developers have come up with the perfect
      amortization program and you want to install it on the workgroup server
      for other systems to remotely mount and use. Because this is a third-party
      or custom application, the logical place for it is in /usr/local/appname,
      possibly with a link to the program binary in the /usr/local/bin directory
      (because that's in the path).

        If given a choice between putting the software package
        <span class="alert--bigprog">bigprog</span> in the
        <strong>/usr/local/<span class="alert--bigprog">bigprog</span></strong>
        section and the
        <strong>/opt/<span class="alert--bigprog">bigprog</span></strong>
        section, it's hard to choose. Read any relevant exam question
        closely--the main difference being that the
        <strong>/opt</strong> section is not considered to be sharable, whereas
        the <strong>/usr</strong> section is often shared and mounted by client
        systems.

      <div class="paragraph--paragraph">
        A major section of the 101 exam is dedicated to how to run commands
        properly with the right options and arguments. As a good sysadmin,
        you'll be expected to know how to create, delete, edit, set permissions
        on, display, move, copy, and determine the type of files and programs.

        You must be able to pick proper and working commands out of lists of

      <h2 class="paragraph--h2">Tips for working with Linux files</h2>
      <div class="paragraph--paragraph">
        Because most users and sysadmins come from a Windows or other OS
        background, a quick set of recommendations for the less-experienced can
        be of help here:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3 class="paragraph--h3">Hidden files aren't really hidden-</h3>
          They just begin with a ., such as the
          <span class="paragraph--small">.bashrc</span> and
          <span class="paragraph--small">.bash_profile</span> files. These are
          not viewable by normal users with conventional commands and switches
          and aren't deleted by commands such as
          <span class="paragraph--small">rm -f *.*</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="paragraph--h3">
            Filenames can contain multiple periods or no period characters-
          </h3>
          The filenames
          <span class="paragraph--small">this.is.a.long.file</span> and
          <span class="paragraph--small">thisisalongfile</span> are perfectly
          reasonable and possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3 class="paragraph--h3">
            Spaces in filenames look nice, but are a pain to type-
          </h3>
          Use an _ or a - instead of spaces because it's neater and easier than
          prefixing all spaces with a <span class="paragraph--small">\</span>.
          (To display a space in a filename, the system shows a space prefixes
          with a backslash.)
